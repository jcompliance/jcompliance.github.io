This COVID-19 does give lots of opportunities of running webinars. While in conferences you can at least look at audiences' faces, in webinars you learn how to talk to the fully muted silent many people. Now I am starting to get used to it.

On 29th Apr, I've run a webinar together with my colleague about how Cloudflare can help mobile payment industry, focusing on how to accelerate and secure mobile payment applications. Although the rapid move to cloud is happening in every industry, there're still challenges and technical debts that are unaddressed. In this webinar we drew an overview picture of Cloudflare as a Cloud based solution and described how it can help financial industry and introduced reference customers.
