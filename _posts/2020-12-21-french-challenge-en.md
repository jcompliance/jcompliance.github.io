Since June my French study is paused. My baby level French going rusty! I wanted to restart to study, so my new challenge for myself is to write any random things in French for 100 days, so I could use the words and exercise structuring sentences. 

What I write may not make any sense as it's just part of exercising. I'm literally using this blog as language practice notebook.
