I"óD<p>Not really a thorough tutorial but a quick guide for administrators who require so-called <code class="highlighter-rouge">Staging Environment</code> where you can test your new CDN or security configuration in a sandbox environment. Like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I want to deploy a new Firewall Rule (or a caching rule, vice versa) and want to verify first with my QA team if my legit app request will remain safe.</li>
  <li>I want to deploy a new Cloudflare product but want to test it with my staging env before deploying it to my production.</li>
  <li>And many others.</li>
</ul>

<p>As far as I know (and wish) thatâ€™s a equivelant work going on by Cloudflareâ€™s product team to provide this. But if we need it today, thereâ€™s a workaround. So this article will walk you through on how I guide my customers to set one up.</p>

<h1 id="optional-set-up-a-dedicated-dashboard-for-staging-domain-name">(Optional) Set up a dedicated dashboard for staging domain name</h1>

<p>This is optional step but it will be more handy to have another separated dashboard for only staging subdomain where you can freely play with.</p>

<p>Decide a domain for staging environment. In this example, Iâ€™ll be using <code class="highlighter-rouge">staging.blog.jeann.net</code> for staging environment of <code class="highlighter-rouge">blog.jeann.net</code>. Using subdomain is handy but having subdomain-level dashboard is ENT only feature. If youâ€™re not an enterprise customer, itâ€™s ok to set up a staging domain name under different root domain.</p>

<p>So, letâ€™s say your production domain is <code class="highlighter-rouge">blog.jeann.net</code></p>

<ul>
  <li>I want to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">staging.blog.jeann.net</code> as staging domain name and separate a dedicated dashboard for this host.
 -&gt; This is enterprise only. <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026440252-Understanding-Subdomain-Support">More read here</a></li>
  <li>I would rather use different root domain like <code class="highlighter-rouge">blog.jeann.cf</code> to set this up.
 -&gt; Possible for everyone. Just follow usual onboarding steps.</li>
</ul>

<p>You may proceed to <code class="highlighter-rouge">add a site</code> button at the Cloudflare dashboard to finalize this step.</p>

<h1 id="add-a-new-subdomain-in-cloudflare-dns">Add a new subdomain in Cloudflare DNS</h1>

<p>I have a DNS entry in my dashboard that connects <code class="highlighter-rouge">blog.jeann.net</code> to the origin instance, which looks like below.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>| Type         | Name                   | Content          | Proxy Status |
| A/AAAA/CNAME | blog.jeann.net         | &lt;ORIGIN ADDRESS&gt; | ON           |
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Go to your new dashboard and make sure your staing domain has same origin address with proxy turned on.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>| Type         | Name                   | Content          | Proxy Status |
| A/AAAA/CNAME | staging.blog.jeann.net | &lt;ORIGIN ADDRESS&gt; | ON           |
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>or</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>| Type         | Name                   | Content          | Proxy Status |
| A/AAAA/CNAME | blog.jeann.cf          | &lt;ORIGIN ADDRESS&gt; | ON           |
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Based on what staging host youâ€™re using. The point is to make a staging host and make sure they point to the same origin of <code class="highlighter-rouge">blog.jeann.net</code> so we can display exact live site at <code class="highlighter-rouge">staging.blog.jeann.net</code> but still freely test lots of Cloudflare products without impacting real users.</p>

<h1 id="make-sure-you-get-200ok">Make sure you get 200/OK</h1>

<p>Completed step 1~2? Then please check if that subdomain responds well to your query. Most of the cases you need additional configurations, because often the origin servers have host check for incoming requests or redirection logic in place. Actually it means your origin doesnâ€™t have enough security measures in place if you already see 200/OK without any action in this sectionâ€¦ #DevoirAlertForSecurityTeam</p>

<p>In my case the answer is 404;</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">terminal</span><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">curl</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">svo</span> <span class="sr">/dev/nu</span><span class="n">ll</span><span class="o">/</span> <span class="n">https</span><span class="ss">:/</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">staging</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">blog</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">jeann</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">net</span><span class="o">/</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">&gt;&amp;</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">grep</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">e</span> <span class="s2">"&lt; HTTP"</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">e</span> <span class="s2">"&lt; date"</span>

<span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">HTTP</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">2</span> <span class="mi">404</span>

<p>This indicates my origin does not have redirection logic for unknown host but it fails to fetch the correct contents to serve. There are origins that does host check and reject the requests coming from unknown hosts too. Well known example is AWS S3. Youâ€™ll see <code class="highlighter-rouge">403 Forbidden</code> when trying to connect the assets via unknown hosts. Another example is AWS Cloudfront. If it doesnâ€™t regonize a host theyâ€™ll try to redirect. In any cases, the problem is the origin does not regonize and understand the host and refuses to serve the content.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>--------------          ---------------------             --------------------

                                                  "origin doesn't understand
                                                    stg.blog.jeann.net."
                                                   returns 404 not found,
                                                           403 forbidden,
                                                           or 301 redirection
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are one easy way and one fundamental way to solve this problem and set staging environment.</p>

<h2 id="use-host-header-override-to-trick-the-origin-ent-only">Use host header override to trick the origin (ENT ONLY)</h2>

<p>This is an easy way. Cloudflare provides a way to tweak http.host value when sending the request back to the origin. You can set it up in Page Rules but the option is enterprise only. In many cases, youâ€™ll solve the problem with the page rule.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">terminal</span><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">curl</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">svo</span> <span class="sr">/dev/nu</span><span class="n">ll</span><span class="o">/</span> <span class="n">https</span><span class="ss">:/</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">staging</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">blog</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">jeann</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">net</span><span class="o">/</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">&gt;&amp;</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">grep</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">e</span> <span class="s2">"&lt; HTTP"</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">e</span> <span class="s2">"&lt; date"</span>

<span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">HTTP</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">2</span> <span class="mi">200</span>

<p>Why the origin behaviour changed? Because once you set it up, the request will look like below.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>--------------          ---------------------             --------------------
| Request    |          | Cloudflare Proxy   |            | origin server of |
| to staging |          | stg.blog.jeann.net |            | blog.jeann.net   |
--------------          ---------------------             --------------------
       host: stg.blog.jeann.net                host: blog.jeann.net
        --------------------&gt;                --------------------&gt;   
                                                  "I know this host.
                                                   I can serve the request."
                                                   returns 200 OK
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Quick and happy if it solves the origin issue. However thereâ€™re the other ways (e.g. certificate SAN) than host to check if the requests are coming from a foreign host and if the origin still reacts weirdly like keep redirecting you to original host (e.g. Cloudfront) - you need to proceed to the fundamental way.</p>

<h2 id="make-sure-your-origin-recognize-your-staging-domain-name">Make sure your origin recognize your staging domain name.</h2>

<p>This is a fundamental way. You will configure at the origin console to make sure your origin recornizes and acknowledges the staging host you set. Youâ€™d need to make sure the origin does serve the contents to your specific foreign host. Look at your cloud console of consult with your web server admin, and make sure you get 200/OK.</p>

<h1 id="optional-copy-cloudflare-configurations-to-the-staging-zone">(Optional) Copy Cloudflare configurations to the staging zone</h1>

<p>Completed til step 3? Nice! Youâ€™re all set. Now you have two Cloudflare zones that connect to the same application but they are different because:</p>

<p>while as-is setup does this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>-----------------          ---------------------          --------------------
| Request       |          | Cloudflare Proxy  |          | origin server    |
| to production |          | blog.jeann.net    |          | blog.jeann.net   |
-----------------          ---------------------          --------------------
              --------------&gt;
Requesters are              Changes made at this zone
your customers              will affect your customers directly
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The one we set up will allow you to have below setup, additionally.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>-----------------          ---------------------          --------------------
| Request       |          | Cloudflare Proxy   |         | origin server    |
| to staging    |          | stg.blog.jeann.net |         | blog.jeann.net   |

your developers/QA            will not affect your customers
                              and allow you to preview as-is and to-be
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It is recommended to establish a process on your end to always test first with <code class="highlighter-rouge">staging.blog.jeann.net</code> before deploying the new product or feature to <code class="highlighter-rouge">blog.jeann.net</code>.</p>

<p>As you just set up staging environment you may want to copy your dashboard configuration for <code class="highlighter-rouge">blog.jeann.net</code> onto <code class="highlighter-rouge">staging.blog.jeann.net</code>. Thereâ€™s no super handy way to do this today(2020-05-31), most of the customers do it manually but if youâ€™re familiar with <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/">this well-known configuration management orchestration opensource software</a>, you can manage Cloudflare configuration there.</p>

<h1 id="set-up-an-auth-so-only-your-devops-can-access">Set up an auth so only your devops can access</h1>

<p>Who likes to allow random people to access our companyâ€™s staging environment? You do not want to open this <code class="highlighter-rouge">staging.blog.jeann.net</code> up to the public internet. You want to authenticate your devops engineers or QA engineers and make sure only they are able to see staging website not random people outside of the world. There are one intuitive way, and one prettier way to achieve this.</p>

<h2 id="use-firewall-rules">Use Firewall Rules</h2>

<p>This is an intuitive way. Youâ€™ll specify IP addesses, AS Number, or Cookie, etc to distinguish your developers before they access the application. The rule will look like this.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>http.host eq "staging.blog.jeann.net" and 
ip.src ne 1.2.3.4 (e.g. your office IP) and 
http.user_agent ne "pre-defined-UA" 
then BLOCK
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Any Cloudflare customers can use this feature to configure customized security rule. <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/firewall/">Read more to learn further.</a></p>

<h2 id="use-access">Use Access</h2>

<p>This is a prettier way. Without having to deploy anything on your origin, use Cloudflare to force authentication before they access. You will configure the policy first to decide who can see staging website like:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>jean@yourcompany.com ------------- ALLOW
charlotte@yourcompany.com -------- ALLOW
george@yourcompany.com -----------  DENY
any others at @yourcompany.com --- ALLOW
otherwise ------------------------  DENY
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And youâ€™ll integrate Cloudflare Access with Google or G-suite, Okta, Azure AD, Facebook, whatever youâ€™d like to use for login. So when you access <code class="highlighter-rouge">staging.blog.jeann.net</code> youâ€™ll have to firstly log-in with your devops/QA account.</p>

<p>As of 31 May, it is what is already set in my staging environment: <a href="https://staging.blog.jeann.net/">https://staging.blog.jeann.net/</a></p>

<p>Visit <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/access/">here to learn more</a>. By the way, you need to have Cloudflare Access in your contract to use this method. If you donâ€™t, firewall rules can still help.</p>

<h1 id="well-done">Well done!</h1>

<p>Happy playing with experimental features in your Cloudflare staging environment!</p>

<p>There really are lots of features you may turn on to make application cooler and faster!</p>
