I"æ<p>In <a href="https://blog.jeann.net/cloudflare/logs/2019/03/19/pulling-cloudflare-logs-with-bash.html">this previous article</a> I have talked about how to pull Cloudflare raw logs periodically and save them in your choice of storage server. Thatâ€™s one way of retrieving Cloudflare logs. However more recommended way is to set a Logpush endpoint so you do not have to even run the script, Cloudflare pushes logs periodically to your storage, every 5 minutes.</p>

<h1 class="no_toc" id="prerequisite">Prerequisite</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Cloudflare Enterprise Zone &amp; Dashboard Access (Raw log feature is enterprise only)</li>
  <li>Your Ready-to-use Cloud Storage (has to be one of the below - as of May 15 2020.)
    <ul>
      <li>Google Cloud Storage</li>
      <li>AWS S3</li>
      <li>Microsoft Azure</li>
      <li>Sumologic (Sumo is a SIEM, but can directly get logs from Cloudflare.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Iâ€™m using Google Cloud Storage here.</p>

<h2 id="decide-your-storage-folderpath-that-you-would-like-to-receive-cloudflare-logs">Decide your storage folder/path that you would like to receive Cloudflare logs.</h2>

<p>At Google Cloud Storage, Iâ€™ve created a storage <code class="highlighter-rouge">jean-logstream</code> and Iâ€™ll be receiving my Cloudflare logs in a folder <code class="highlighter-rouge">http-requests</code>. The console should look like below.</p>

<p><img src="https://jeann.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-27-at-11.52.53-AM.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="navigate-to-cloudflare-dashboard-analytics-logs">Navigate to Cloudflare dashboard, Analytics-Logs.</h2>

<p>You should see a panel like below.</p>

<p><img src="https://jeann.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-27-at-11.39.51-AM.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="select-gcs">Select GCS.</h2>

<p>Click <code class="highlighter-rouge">Connect a service</code>. Choose <code class="highlighter-rouge">Google Cloud Storage</code>. Click <code class="highlighter-rouge">Next</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://jeann.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-27-at-11.56.31-AM.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="configure-the-storage-path-youve-created-at-step-1">Configure the storage path youâ€™ve created at step 1.</h2>

<p>In my case, <code class="highlighter-rouge">jean-logstream/http-requests</code>. Replace this with your path. For daily subfolders, Iâ€™d recommend you select <code class="highlighter-rouge">Yes, automatically organize logs in daily subfolders</code>, because youâ€™re supposed to receive quite a lot of number of JSON files each day.</p>

<p><img src="https://jeann.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-27-at-11.57.52-AM.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="add-a-iam-user-at-your-gcs">Add a IAM user at your GCS.</h2>

<p>This is to grant Cloudflare access to upload files in your bucket.</p>

<p>Step for this could be different based on storage product youâ€™ve chosen. For Google Cloud Storage, follow below steps.</p>

<p>a. Copy <code class="highlighter-rouge">Cloudflare IAM user to add</code></p>

<p>b. Navigate to your storage. In my case, it is <code class="highlighter-rouge">jean-logstream</code>. Navigate to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Permissions</code> tab at your storage.</p>

<p><img src="https://jeann.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-27-at-12.05.05-PM.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>c. Click <code class="highlighter-rouge">Add Members</code>.</p>

<p>d. Paste Cloudflare IAM user at <code class="highlighter-rouge">New Members</code>. Select <code class="highlighter-rouge">Storage Object Admin</code> as a role. Click <code class="highlighter-rouge">Save</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://jeann.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-27-at-12.06.36-PM-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once this is done, at Cloudflare Logpush, click <code class="highlighter-rouge">Validate Access</code>. If the step is done correctly, it will show <code class="highlighter-rouge">Validated</code> and bring you to the next step.</p>

<h2 id="provide-cloudflare-logpush-an-ownership-token">Provide Cloudflare Logpush an Ownership Token.</h2>

<p>This is to prove your ownership of the storage. Since IAM access is granted, Cloudflare wouldâ€™ve added a ownership challenge file in your storage folder.</p>

<p><img src="https://jeann.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-27-at-12.08.56-PM.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Navigate to your Google Storage. In my case, I should go to <code class="highlighter-rouge">jean-logstream/http-requests</code>. There should be a new file added by Cloudflare.</p>

<p><img src="https://jeann.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-27-at-12.12.51-PM.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Copy-paste the content of the file to Cloudflare Logpush, and click <code class="highlighter-rouge">Prove Ownership</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://jeann.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-27-at-12.13.59-PM.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="select-which-set-of-logs-youd-like-to-be-pushed">Select which set of logs youâ€™d like to be pushed.</h2>

<p>As of 15 May 2020, below are available data.</p>

<ul>
  <li>HTTP Requests : Raw logs from Cloudflareâ€™s standard product for HTTP/S applications. Have security +  performance + detailed information of what happened.</li>
  <li>Spectrum Events : Event logs from Cloudflare Spectrum, for non-web TCP/UDP applications.</li>
  <li>Firewall Events(API only now) : Security events for Cloudflareâ€™s standard product for HTTP/S applications.</li>
</ul>

<p>Iâ€™ll choose HTTP requests for this tutorial. Once you select <code class="highlighter-rouge">HTTP Requests</code>, you can select which fields youâ€™d like to be pushed. You can start from <code class="highlighter-rouge">All fields</code>, and optimize further based on your needs.</p>

<p>Below are advanced options.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Timestamp format: use <code class="highlighter-rouge">RFC3339</code> unless you have specific needs to get it in unix format.</li>
  <li>Sampling: If you wish to get randomly sampled % of logs instead of 100%, decide sample rate here.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="well-done">Well done!</h2>

<p>Now you should see Cloudflare logs coming through at your storage.</p>

<p><img src="https://jeann.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-27-at-12.22.29-PM.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Note that if your storage becomes unavailable, or if you delete Cloudflare IAM user, this console will show error and youâ€™ll be missing Cloudflare logs during that time.</p>
