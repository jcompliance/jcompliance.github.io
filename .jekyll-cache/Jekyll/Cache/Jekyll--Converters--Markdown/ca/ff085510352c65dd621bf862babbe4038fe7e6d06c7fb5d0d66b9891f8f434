<p>A good day to you! My name is Jean Ryu and I love solving problems with proper solutions.</p>

<p>I am currently a solutions engineer at <code class="highlighter-rouge">Cloudflare</code>. Cloudflare helps build a better internet, meaning safer, faster and more reliable. Cloudflare’s network, AS13335 is one of the most-interconnected network in the world. Here I am helping our enterprise clients quantify business pain points, come up with the best solutions, onboard with the solution by implementing/integrating. I also help our clients get trained with the platform so they can extract the most value of Cloudflare.</p>

<p>Before joining Cloudflare, I’ve stayed with <code class="highlighter-rouge">Korea Internet &amp; Security Agency</code> based out of Seoul, South Korea. KISA takes care of Korea’s ccTLD(.kr, .한국) and new gTLD operations as well as cybersecurity regulations such as ISMS. I was part of technical operations team and took care of datacenter &amp; network operations of .kr DNS network, and IPv6 based IX (AS17832). I was in charge of security operations as well when KISA KRNIC’s operaions underwent security audits/compliances.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I enjoy spending time in learning new languages. I am native in Korean and fluent in English. I learned Japanese, Chinese(Mandarin) and French for fun. Although none of the three is great in business level (yet) in Japanese I can communicate pretty freely, also can watch programs without subtitle. In Chinese and French I can briefly introduce myself and survive in country without speaking English. I also enjoy traveling. I dream of crossing Eurasian continent only by train someday - my current footprint can be found <a href="https://www.mytravelmap.xyz/u/fb1018132231568410;jsessionid=D0E35A020D608DACACBC2805D33A5434?0">here</a>.</p>
